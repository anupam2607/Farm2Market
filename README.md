# Farm2Market
FARM2MARKET is a web-based platform designed to empower small and marginal farmers in India by enabling them to sell their crops directly to consumers, such as households, restaurants, and local vendors — without involving middlemen. The platform also integrates a machine learning-based price prediction system to provide farmers with smart, data-driven suggestions on when and at what price to sell their produce.
Firstly we made a folder data which has all our dataset which is used to trail our ml model to predict the future price of crops , which helps farmer to do stalk his crops to when he wanted to sell his crop to buy a maximum profit.
then we created  our home page as index.html and in it we integrated our registration window as registration.html this registration widow helps farmer to register as seller with his personal details ,and this window also used to regiter for buyers also if they want to buy some crops with his personal details .
we also integrated news.html file becouse farmers are unaware of current news .
then we itegrated govt.html file which tells about all govt schemes which are introduced by govt. of india , this is becouse most of the farmers are unaware of govt. policies which helps farmer to get max. profit from his crops .
then we added a chatbot which helps farmers to take max. info about their crops or anything else by integretning api in it .
and we added all the imges which are used by our ui ..

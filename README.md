# Farm2Market
FARM2MARKET is a web-based platform designed to empower small and marginal farmers in India by enabling them to sell their crops directly to consumers, such as households, restaurants, and local vendors — without involving middlemen. The platform also integrates a machine learning-based price prediction system to provide farmers with smart, data-driven suggestions on when and at what price to sell their produce.
Firstly we made a folder data which has all our dataset which is used to train our ml model to predict the future price of crops , which helps farmers the price of cropand helps to predict  to when the farmer should sell the crop to get maximum profit.
Then we created  our home page as index.html and in it we integrated our registration window as registration.html, this registration window helps farmer to register as seller with his personal details ,and the same window also used to register for buyers also if they want to buy some crops with his personal details .
We also integrated news.html file because farmers are unaware of current news regarding farming .
Then we itegrated govt.html file which tells about all govt. schemes which are introduced by govt. of India , this is because most of the farmers are unaware of govt. policies which helps farmer to get max. profit foe there crops .
Then we added a chatbot which helps farmers to take max. information about their crops or anything else by integretning api in it .
And also we added all the images which are used by our ui ..
